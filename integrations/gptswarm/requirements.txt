# GPTSwarm optional dependencies
# 
# Install this on top of requirements.txt when you want to use GPTSwarm:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt -r integrations/gptswarm/requirements.txt
#
# Note: GPTSwarm requires httpx<0.26.0, so we override the httpx version
# from requirements.txt here. This is safe because GPTSwarm is only used
# in optional experiment scripts, not in the core AgentVerse deployment.

httpx>=0.25.2,<0.26.0
